# Smorgasbord

To start both the server and the client at the same time, execute:
```
docker-compose up
```
This will run them in parallel after building the images.

If you want to execute them separately, or just hate docker, you can still cd into `/server` and `/client` and do an `npm start` in each location.

The React App is visible at http://localhost:3000.
